<p><i><b>Grading:</b></i><br /><br />
The course grade is calculated as a weighted average of grades in seven categories. In each category, a grade is earned as a percentage from 0% to 100% that is based on an equal averaging of items in that category. The percentage grade for each category is multiplied by the weighting percentage to determine the category’s contribution to the total grade. The sum of contributions from the seven categories yields the final grade.<br /> <br /> <i>Categories and Weights</i><br /> <br /> Assignments: 15%<br /> Retrospectives: 10%<br /> Quizzes: 15%<br /> Midterm Exam: 15%<br /> Midterm Project: 15%<br /> Final Exam: 15%<br /> Final Project: 15%<br /> <br /> <i>Grading Scale</i><br /> <br /> A+ = 98–100%, A = 93–97%, A- = 90–92%<br /> B+ = 87–89%, B = 83–86%, B- = 80–82%<br /> C+ = 77–79%, C = 73–76%, C- = 70–72%<br /> D+ = 67–69%, D = 63–66%, D- = 60–62%<br /> F = 59% and below<br /> <br /> <i>Challenge Grading</i><br /> <br /> Unless otherwise specified, challenges will be graded on effort. Effort is measured on a number of different criteria; including, but not limited to, correctness, amount of work attempted, amount of work completed, using support material, asking for help, and meeting challenge requirements.<br /> <br /> <i>Midterm Project and Final Project Grading</i><br /> <br /> The midterm project and the final Project are graded on correctness and the quality of the work. <br /> Grades for challenges, activities, and retrospectives will be posted one week after the due date. Quizzes and exams are auto-graded in Canvas and grades will be posted immediately once the quiz or exam is submitted.</p>

<p><i><b>Course Policies:</b></i><br />
<ul><li>All challenges, activities, quizzes and exams have to be submitted by their due dates to receive credit.</li> <li>You are responsible for keeping up-to-date on the work you are to be doing for this course. While reminders will be sent out based on the schedule, it is up to you to complete the work in a timely manner.</li> <li>You must fulfill the requirements of a challenge submission to receive credit for that challenge. Any information you are asked to provide or files you are asked to supply must be present to receive credit for the challenge.</li></ul></p>

<p><i><b>Netiquette &amp; Community Policies: </b></i>
The University of Missouri-Columbia is committed to providing courses that meet the highest standards of excellence with the mission of preparing students to become productive members of society and good citizens of the world (<a href='https://www.umsystem.edu/ums/rules/collected_rules/programs/ch200/200.010_standard_of_conduct' target='_blank'>University Standard of Conduct</a>), University of Missouri-Columbia. As such, students are expected to maintain a standard of conduct. A challenge in the online classroom is understanding the meaning of communications without the visual and auditory clues from the speaker. Netiquette provides some basic guidelines about how to behave in an online format, such as not using all capital letters online because that represents the vocal equivalent of shouting. In addition to these basics, please remember that this is an academic course where much of the work is taking place online. It is not the same as communicating with friends via social media, nor is it equivalent to sending text messages to friends or colleagues. These guidelines below will help you reduce online miscommunications in this course.</p>

<p><i><b>General Netiquette Rules: </b></i><br />
 <ul> <li><b>Make the Connection</b>. Electronic communication (email, discussion forums, Discord, etc.) is how you share ideas with other participants in this course. Online environments can separate the person from the ideas received in this course. Remember, like you, someone is on the other side of an email or discussion posting. Communicate with fellow participants as you would in a face-to-face course.</li> <li><b>Be Professional</b>. Your coursework is more than learning facts; you are preparing for a career. You are learning to interact with your fellow course participants as you would in your future professional life. Your conduct in this course should reflect this. Your communication should follow standard rules for grammar and spelling (unless in an online chat) and be clear, concise and intelligent.</li> <li><b>Have Opinions</b>. Everyone is entitled to have an opinion. In discussion forums, everyone is encouraged to share them.</li> <li><b>Respect Disagreement</b>. People have the right to disagree with you. However, disagreement should never be personal. Online discussions are a means to share ideas and practice the skill of persuasion. Persuasive speech cannot be achieved with hurtful, hateful or inappropriate language. Review your posts before you publish and reread them for unintended meanings.</li> <li><b>Ask Questions</b>. Cultural influences can influence communication in terms of phrasing and word choice. The lack of visual and auditory clues may affect meaning, as well. Before jumping to conclusions, ask for clarification.</li> <li><b>Be Forgiving</b>. For the majority of participants, online communication is straightforward. Sometimes unintended meanings are conveyed.</li> </ul> </p>

<p><i><b>If Conflicts Arise: </b></i>
Online behavior is not always perfect. In fact it can venture into disrespectful and hurtful areas and needs to be addressed. If you experience any questionable or outright inappropriate behavior from your fellow course participants, please contact the instructor.<br /> <br /> This Netiquette policy was adapted from Howard Community College’s [<a href='Netiquette Statement' target='_blank'>http://www.howardcc.edu</a>] and Virgina Shea’s <a href='The Core Rules of Netiquette'>http://www.albion.com</a>).</p>

<p><i><b>Exepectations for Students:</b></i><br />
<ul><li>Be responsible for yourself, your work, and your actions.</li> <li>Attend to the work you have to do. Do not put it off. Make it part of your schedule.</li> <li>Do not try to do all of the work just before a deadline.</li> <li>Ask questions if you do not understand something.</li> <li>Engage in discussions with other students and faculty.</li> <li>Ask for help if you get lost. Use the learning support staff.</li> <li>Communicate!</li> <li>Do not wait until late in the semester to address problems.</li> <li>Do not ask the instructor to break class policies.</li> <li>Plan.</li> <li>Be creative, curious, inventive, resourceful, and proactive.</li> <li>Be playful in your approach to learning and the work you do.</li> <li>Play nice with others.</li> <li>Have fun.</li></ul></p>

<p><i><b>Academic Honesty:</b></i><br /><br />
Academic integrity is fundamental to the activities and principles of a university. All members of the academic community must be confident that each person’s work has been responsibly and honorably acquired, developed, and presented. Any effort to gain an advantage not given to all students is dishonest whether or not the effort is successful. The academic community regards breaches of the academic integrity rules as extremely serious matters. Sanctions for such a breach may include academic sanctions from the instructor, including failing the course for any violation, to disciplinary sanctions ranging from probation to expulsion. When in doubt about plagiarism, paraphrasing, quoting, collaboration, or any other form of cheating, consult the course instructor.</p>

<p><i><b>Intellectual Property Notice:</b></i><br /><br />
All course materials including but not limited to the syllabus, course assignments, study guides, learning guides, online lecture videos and content, and lab book (i.e. course pack) are property of the instructor and/or University and may not be shared online or distributed in any manner to others. Students are prohibited from posting course materials or notes online and from selling notes to or being paid for taking notes by any person or commercial firm without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course. Doing so will constitute both an academic integrity violation and a copyright violation. Violations of copyright laws could subject you to civil penalties and criminal liability. Violations of academic integrity may subject you to disciplinary action under University policies.</p>

<p><i><b>Classroom Misconduct:</b></i><br /><br />
Classroom misconduct is defined by the University of Missouri’s collected rules and regulations are also outlined in the M-Book Student Code of Conduct.<br /> <br /> <a href='https://www.umsystem.edu/ums/rules/collected_rules/programs/ch200/200.010_standard_of_conduct' target='_blank'>https://www.umsystem.edu/ums/rules/collected_rules/programs/ch200/200.010_standard_of_conduct</a><br /> <a href='https://accountability.missouri.edu/university-policies/' target='_blank'>https://accountability.missouri.edu/university-policies/</a><br /> <br /> Classroom misconduct includes forgery of class attendance; obstruction or disruption of teaching, including late arrival or early departure; failure to turn off cellular telephones leading to disruption of teaching; playing games or surfing the Internet on laptop computers unless instructed to do so; harassment, bullying, physical abuse or safety threats; theft; property damage; disruptive, lewd or obscene conduct; abuse of computer time; repeated failure to attend class when attendance is required; and repeated failure to participate or respond in class when class participation is required.<br /> <br /> IMPORTANT: Entering a classroom late or leaving a classroom before the end of the period can be extremely disruptive behavior. Students are asked to arrive for class on time and to avoid early departures. Instructors have the right to deny students access to the classroom if they arrive late and have the right to dismiss a student from the class for early departures that result in disruptions.<br /> <br /> Under MU policy, your instructor has the right to ask for your removal from the course for misconduct, disruptive behavior or excessive absences. The instructor then has the right to issue a grade of withdraw, withdraw failing or F. The instructor alone is responsible for assigning the grade in such circumstances.</p>

<p><i><b>Dishonesty and Misconduct Reporting Procedures:</b></i><br /><br />
MU faculty are required to report all instances of academic or classroom misconduct to the appropriate campus officials. Allegations of classroom misconduct will be forwarded immediately to MU’s Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. Allegations of academic misconduct will be forwarded immediately to MU’s Office of the Provost.</p>
